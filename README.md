# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains a collection of examples and exercises from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron. The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through the book by experimenting with the code examples and completing exercises, enabling others to learn from my notes and code snippets.


## About the Book

This book provides practical guidance on using machine learning with Python, covering foundational concepts, tools, and techniques. It covers a wide range of topics, including:

- Supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Neural networks and deep learning (e.g., Keras, TensorFlow)
- Model deployment and working with real-world data

## Libraries Used

This repository leverages the following Python libraries:

- **numpy**: For numerical computing and array operations.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- **scipy**: For scientific computing and advanced math functions.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **tensorflow.keras**: For building and training deep learning models.
